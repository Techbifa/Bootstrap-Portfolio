    <p>I was born in Upstate New York on the 19th of December, 1977.</p>

    <p></p>I only spent a few years in the U.S before my family emigrated back to Nigeria, where I ultimately grew up.</p>

    <p>My upbringing in the 80’s and 90’s was that of a typical Nigerian kid- lots of school work, chores, and wondering why
        Americans on TV kissed in the street.</p>

    <p>After secondary school, I made a decision, along with my parents to move back to the U.S by myself, and landed in Philadelphia
        in October, 1996. I stayed with a cousin whom I had grown up with, back in Lagos, and who had come to the U.S ahead
        of me, by a couple of years. In time, I signed up for Nursing School, and worked at UPS and a Nursing Home at night,
        and on weekends to put myself through school.</p>

    <p>After graduation, I started my Nursing career at Pennsylvania Hospital, where I worked for 13 years, before transitioning
        from the bedside to Case Management for an insurance company.</p>

    <p>After 17 years as a nurse, I’m looking to broaden my horizons, so I decided to enroll in the Penn Coding Bootcamp. It’s
        been an interesting experience so far.</p>
